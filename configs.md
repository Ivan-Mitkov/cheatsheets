vim:
F3 toggles between paste and nopaste mode - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2514445/turning-off-auto-indent-when-pasting-text-into-vim
`set hlsearch` highlights every result of a keyword-search (comment it out for not highlighting)






fish:
`fish_vi_key_bindings` sets vim mode in fish (fish autocomplete command (ctrl +F) doesn't work in this mode)
`fish_hybrid_key_bindings` works in vim mode too
