kernel has access to all physical resources
docker only exposes computer's kernel - nothing else - not even os - that's why your containers need os
but every os(container and host) must have the same kernel
dockerfile indicates how to build the container
"docker build" command passes the dockerfile to docker engine, docker engine follows the instructions in dockerfile and builds the docker image, which starts the container
